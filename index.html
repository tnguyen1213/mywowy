		<h1>Welcome to mywowy.org!</h1>
		<p>Thank you for joining me on my voyage of exploration! This website is a collection of topics that make me go, "Wow!". I have never been content with just learning something without knowing all the "whys". While going down the rabbit hole in my exploration of a topic, I often find myself asking, "how did I get here?!". This is my attempt to document my breadcrumbs in my exploration of knowledge. Please buckle up and enjoy the ride with me!</p>
